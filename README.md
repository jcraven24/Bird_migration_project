# Bird_migration_project

To run this code you need the dataset in the csv provided, a mapbox token created at mapbox.com and the packages provided in the notebook.

Download the csv and create your own mapbox token. Then paste just your token into a file just named ".mapbox_token" (without the quotes).

After that, download the zip and open the notebook, you should be able to run the code!

If you run into issues, make sure you have the csv and mapbox token, and make sure they are all located within the same directory.
